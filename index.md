The [first Edge Intelligence Workshop](https://www.gerad.ca/colloques/EdgeIntelligence2020/proceedings.html) was held successfully in [2-3 March 2020](https://www.gerad.ca/en/posts/849) with more than 100 participants from academia and industry.

## Edge Intelligence Workshop 2022

The goal of the **2nd Edge Intelligence Workshop** is to bring together academic and industry researchers working in the field of neural network computational acceleration on methodology, theory, application, and beyond.

There is an emerging interest in edge implementation of deep neural networks, but this direction has no specific scientific event dedicated to it so far. This workshop aims at closing this gap.

We hope to provide a platform to establish relationship and exchange of ideas between the industry and the academia through technical talks and poster discussions.

We will admit 100 participants only, and the event will appear physically in Montreal downtown. We encourage participants to submit an extended abstract to remain in priority for registration. Selected extended abstracts will be published in a dedicated workshop proceedings. The 1st Edge Intelligence Workshop Proceedings can be downloaded freely from [here](https://www.gerad.ca/en/papers/G-2020-23).
